# A Comprehensive Review on Digital Twins for Smart Energy Management System
## Context
* Energy systems digitalization represents the energy sector's future.
* In a World highly digitalized, we can exploit the potential synergy offered by such interconnected system (game-changer approach).
* **What are the main barriers that are holding back the adoption of digital twins in smart energy systems?** 
* This paper provides a basis for future research that aims at applying the digital twin concept in the energy sector and particularly for power grid management(challenges).
  - Big data management
  - Real-time measurements
  - Continuous communication between real world and digital twin 
  - Investments for measuring systems
  - The issues connected with the use of large data centres 
  
## Introduction
* This technology is translated into a series of sensors installed in the system that feed databases and algorithms  dedicated to analysing the different fluctuations at any time.
* Predict the possible variations in future conditions, which means adapt the operating technologies accordingly
* DT mirror the behavior of the object in the real environment.
* With big volumes of data, we assure high-fidelity of models. It combined with historical data allows DT forecast and predict the system response in different possible future scenarios.
*  *Predictions are important for a efficient and safe system*

## Discussion
### Functioning/operative technologies
* The DT technology is considered the optimal solution for the control of smart energy systems(SES).
* Why DT is a good option for EMS?
  - Monitor a physical system: through on-field sensor and external sources
  - Analyze and plan: the digital model of the real system and several techniques to identify the optimal measures to control the physical system. 
  - Execute/control the real system: this is done though physical assets.
* An edge computing architecture is proposed to overcome such difficulties given their ability to manage heterogeneous data.
* **The main objective of an EMS is to control all assets optimisms different parameters while ensuring several constrains**
* It should be considered that several other data, external to the energy system, are necessary to properly analyze the optimal management strategy(e.g. electricity).
* The advantage offered by DT is the possibility to constantly monitor the system with the appropriated sensors and communication.
  - This enables the DT to check that the real system reacted to an input as expected; otherwise the control system will automatically order a different control strategy.
  - The model automatically analyze the reason that lead to deviations and and will recalibrate itself.
* The ability of the digital model to modify its parameters to always be updated and able to mirror the real system is priceless.

BENCHMARKING
noun[U]
the act of measuring the quality of something by comparing it with something else of an accepted standard.

### Buildings
* Buildings account for a large portion of the overall energy consumption, and this is divided into electricity and thermal demand that are further split in heating and cooling.
* A SES must consider buildings role in the system(as a consumer and provider of services), particularly for flexibility services though demand response programmes
